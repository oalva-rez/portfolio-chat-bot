# Portfolio Chatbot Backend Application

This repository houses the backend application for the interactive chatbot featured on my portfolio website, [ozkaralvarez.com](https://ozkaralvarez.com). The chatbot is designed to provide visitors with a unique, engaging, and personalized experience, leveraging a fine-tuned OpenAI language model that is enriched with data about my professional journey and skills.

## Overview
The backend is built using Node.js and serves as the crucial link between the OpenAI API and the chatbot interface on the portfolio website. It processes incoming chat requests, interacts with the OpenAI model to generate responses, and manages the flow of conversation, ensuring a seamless and intelligent user interaction.

## Key Features
* **OpenAI API Integration:** Utilizes a fine-tuned OpenAI language model to generate relevant and personalized responses based on data about my experiences and expertise.
* **Rate Limiting Middleware:** Implements robust rate limiting to ensure the application's stability and security *(**note:** this component is not included in the repository for security reasons)*.
* **MongoDB Connection:** Connects to a MongoDB instance to store non-identifying chat history, aiding in maintaining a contextual and coherent chat experience.

## Usage

This section guides you through setting up and running the Portfolio Chatbot Backend. As the repository is configured for security and privacy, certain components like the `.env` file, `middleware` folder, and `training_data.json` are excluded and need to be set up manually.

### Prerequisites
Before setting up the Portfolio Chatbot Backend, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

1. **Node.js:** The backend is built on Node.js. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en).

2. **NPM(Node Package Manager):** NPM is used for managing the dependencies. It comes bundled with Node.js, so if you have Node.js installed, you should have NPM as well.

3. **MongoDB:** The application uses MongoDB as its database. You need to have MongoDB set up on your system or have access to a MongoDB database. Visit [MongoDB's official site](https://www.mongodb.com/) for more details on installation and setup.

4. **OpenAI API Key:** You will need an API key from OpenAI for the chatbot to interact with the language model. You can obtain this by signing up on [OpenAI's website](https://openai.com/).

5. **Git:** To clone the repository, you'll need Git installed on your machine. You can download Git from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/).

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:oalva-rez/portfolio-chat-bot.git
    ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
* Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
* Add your MongoDB connection string as `MONGODB_URI=<your_connection_string>`.
* Add your OpenAI API key as `OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>`.

3. **Middleware Setup**:
* As the middleware folder containing `rateLimiter.js` is not included in the repo for security reasons, create a middleware directory.
* Inside middleware, create a `rateLimiter.js` file and implement your rate-limiting logic.

4. **Training Data for OpenAI Model**:
* The `training_data.json` file, which contains the data used for fine-tuning the OpenAI model, is not included. Create this file with your custom training data.

### Running the Application

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```sh
    npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Dev Server**:
   Once the setup is complete, start the server by running:
   ```sh
    npm run dev
   ```
The server should now be running and able to handle requests from the chatbot interface on your portfolio website.
